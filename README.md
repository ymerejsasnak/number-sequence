Number Sequence Quiz Generator






randomize each level a bit so same patterns of transformation are not always used on same levels
just make a sort of queue in beginning that randomly chooses between each two
then pop one off per level (could be [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] or [2,1,4,3,6,5,8,7,10,9] or whatever)

answer options shuffling (and maybe other ways of generating incorrect answers?)
